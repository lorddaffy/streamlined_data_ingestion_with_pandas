# streamlined_data_ingestion_with_pandas
Take a look of my simple work with Data Camp

### Importing Data from Excel Files
```
#Load pandas as pd
import pandas as pd

#Read spreadsheet and assign it to survey_responses
survey_responses = pd.read_excel('fcc_survey.xlsx')

#View the head of the dataframe
print(survey_responses.head())
```
____________________________

### Load a portion of a spreadsheet

```
#Load pandas as pd
import pandas as pd

# Create string of lettered columns to load
col_string = 'AD, AW:BA'

# Load data with skiprows and usecols set
survey_responses = pd.read_excel("fcc_survey_headers.xlsx", 
                        skiprows=2, 
                        usecols=col_string)

# View the names of the columns selected
print(survey_responses.columns)
```

> An Excel workbook may contain multiple sheets of related data. The New Developer Survey response workbook has sheets for different years. Because read_excel() loads only the first sheet by default, you've already gotten survey responses for 2016. Now, you'll create a dataframe of 2017 responses using read_excel()'s sheet_name argument in a couple different ways.

### Select a single sheet
```
import pandas as pd
# Create df from second worksheet by referencing its position
responses_2017 = pd.read_excel("fcc_survey.xlsx",sheet_name=1)
                               
# by sheet name
# responses_2017 = pd.read_excel("fcc_survey.xlsx",sheet_name='2017')

# Graph where people would like to get a developer job
job_prefs = responses_2017.groupby("JobPref").JobPref.count()
job_prefs.plot.barh()
plt.show()
```
